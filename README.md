## Download

* [Version 1.2.2](https://github.com/adamalbrecht/ngModal/archive/1.2.2.zip) - Compatible with Angular 1.2.x.

You can also install the package using [Bower](http://bower.io).

```sh
bower install ngModal
```

Or add it to your bower.json file:

```javascript
dependencies: {
  "ngModal": "~1.2.0"
}
```

## The Basics
To use the library, add the JS file and CSS file, and then include the module in your app:

```javascript
app = angular.module("myApp", ["ngModal"])
```

The directive itself is called *modal-dialog*. The only required attribute is `show`, which should reference a boolean variable that controls whether or not the dialog is shown. Inside, you can put whatever HTML content you'd like.

```html
<modal-dialog show='dialogShown' dialog-title='My Dialog'>
  <p>Dialog content goes in here</p>
</modal-dialog>
```

## Inline Options

There are a few options that be configured inline with attributes.

| Option           | Default | Description                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dialog-title     | null    | Title placed in the header of the modal dialog.                   |
| width            | 50%     | Width of the dialog. Can be specified in px or %.                 |
| height           | 50%     | Height of the dialog. Can be specified in px or %.                |
| on-close         | null    | Call a function when the dialog is closed. Ex: `on-close='foo()'` |
| mantain-position | false   | It keeps dialog current position                                  |

**Example:**

```html
<modal-dialog show='dialogShown' dialog-title='My Dialog' height='400px' width='75%' mantain-position='true'>
  <p>Dialog content goes in here</p>
</modal-dialog>
```

## Configuration Options

You can also pre-configure some options during your app's configuration phase.

```javascript
app.config(function(ngModalDefaultsProvider) {
  ngModalDefaultsProvider.set('option', 'value');
  // Or with a hash
  ngModalDefaultsProvider.set({option: 'value', option2: 'value2'});
})
```

| Option              | Default | Description                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| closeButtonHtml     | 'X'     | By default, the close button is just an X character. But you can set it to any HTML. For example, if you're using font-awesome, you could set it to `<i class='fa fa-times'></i>` |

## Potential Features Down the Road

* Ability to integrate easily with [UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router). This may be possible already, but it needs to be explored.
